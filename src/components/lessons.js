const Juice = 'In the spring of 2012, I signed up for a juice cleanse with a yoga teacher named Kia Miller at the insistence of a friend who swore that I would emerge from the experience reborn. The idea of five days of just juice sounded like a new age nightmare. Still I decided to sign up – mostly because spending five straight mornings with my favorite yoga teacher seemed heavenly. On the first day of our juicing adventure, I gathered with about thirty other juice enthusiasts in a small space in Santa Monica. Kia led us through a kundalini yoga set and then invited us all to share what we hoped to gain from the next five days. Kia has a grace about her that would make you feel safe minutes before you’re about to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower. My fear and anxiety began to ease in her presence. I also took comfort in knowing that many of the people in the group had done Kia’s juice cleanse before. If they lived to tell the tale, I was sure that I could as well. The first day of juicing turned out not to be challenging at all. In fact, it felt almost natural. At that time, I was working for a small criminal defense firm in LA. I had to write a motion that week for a case that I had taken on. That afternoon, with my juice by my side, I wrote with more clarity and focus than I had in years. It was a natural Adderall of sorts. The five days went by remarkably well. In fact, I felt so good that I opted to add an extra sixth day of juicing. On the seventh day, when I decided to integrate food again, I felt like I had eaten a Thanksgiving dinner after only a few bites of salad. I wanted the incredible clarity that I was experiencing to stretch for as long as possible, so I decided to maintain a strict raw food diet following the cleanse. \n My plan was to only eat raw foods for as long as possible. While eating 100 percent raw turned out to be expensive and made going out to eat with others challenging, I enjoyed the energy that I felt from it. But as I got close to the 2-month mark, my body began to show signs of suffering. My hair started falling out. By that point, I had lost too much weight. Although I never formally weigh myself, people I knew were quick to ask me how I had lost so much weight. I started to experience brain fog and dizziness. Finally, one day, I went to Whole Foods and bought two food items – peanut butter and lima beans – which I had never before been drawn to and voraciously ate them as soon as I got home. Clearly my body was craving protein. It took a couple of weeks for me to bounce back from my raw food experiment. As I transitioned back into eating cooked foods my body had trouble digesting. Quinoa, which is generally regarded as a light grain, sat in my stomach like a rock causing uncomfortable cramps and bloating. It was like my system didn’t know how to take in anything but lettuce and carrots. \n A lot of gems came out of this experiment. I realized that each body is different and while some people might do fine on a totally raw food diet for a long period, others may feel better primarily eating cooked foods. I’ve learned that there really is no one size fits all diet. We hear the phrase intuitive eating a lot now in the health and wellness world. I’m drawn to this concept as I believe it is the most supportive of the individual’s experience. A challenge, however, arises when a person has been ignoring his or her body for so long that it becomes.';
const Discipline = 'Gabrielle Roth, the creator of the 5 Rhythms, frequently posed the question, “do you have the discipline to be a free spirit?” Her inquiry encapsulates one of life’s greatest lessons, which is to become fully free, we must be disciplined. However, we also have to be mindful that discipline doesn’t make us so rigid that we overlook the beauty of the moment. After I emerged from my seven-year drug fueled mess, I was intensely focused on finding freedom through meditation. In January 2011 I said goodbye to the hedonist lifestyle I had been living for the last 7 years and switched my focus to yoga, meditation and healthy living. I was ready to sacrifice the quick highs if it meant achieving long-term sustainable contentment. After law school, in the fall of 2011, I visited Bali for three weeks hoping for a spiritual adventure. During the long flight to Bali, I read Paramahansa Yogananda’s Autobiography of a Yogi. I was captivated by the mystical experiences that Yogananda described in his periods of meditation. While some might look on these stories with skepticism, I intuitively felt the world he described was not only real, but something that I could experience as well. \nOnce I landed in Bali, I kept my eyes open for spiritual gatherings. During one of my first nights in Bali, I attended a small meditation class on the beach. The teacher had us sit in stillness for 30 minutes. I thought I was going to die. I watched my mind wildly spin in circles longing for the moment when the teacher would tell us that we could get up. I never knew how difficult it was to simply be. A few days later, I had the blessing of meeting an incredibly generous soul named Monku. Monku was a native Balinese man, who happened to be working as a tour guide on a free-lance basis for one of the hotels where I stayed. I explained to Monku that I wanted to see more of the island but wasn’t sure where to start. Monku said that if I paid for a car rental, he would take me around the island and then at the end of the two-week tour, he just asked that I pay him from my heart. Over those next two weeks, Monku took me all over Bali, showed me how to pray at the Hindu temples, bartered for me in the Baliense markets and generally watched over me. At the end of our time together, Monku took me to his small village. I stayed in a tiny guest room at the house that he and his wife owned. I paid Monku $200 dollars, which was a large sum for him. I also paid for Monku’s hotel rooms and meals during our two-week adventure, so he had no out of pocket expenses. My fear about my job prospects after I returned back to the States caused me to worry about giving him more. \nDuring my last week in Bali, I stayed in Ubud and took classes at the Yoga Barn. One of the classes was called Chakra Meditation. It was led by a British woman named Jelila, who was probably in her 50’s. At the end of the meditation class, Jelila advertised that she offered chakra rebalancing sessions privately at her nearby home. The idea of chakras were new to me. I had never been to an esoteric healer before, but my heart felt a pull to Jelila. After the class, I asked her if I could schedule a session. She invited me to come to her home the next day at 11 am. I arrived the following morning after eating a light breakfast of different fruits. Jelila and I sat in big wicker chairs on her porch overlooking the verdant rice fields. She started by leading me through a guided meditation, the details of which I cannot remember. \n After she finished guiding me through the meditation, I sat in stillness, thinking that she would prompt me to open my eyes and come back into the space. But she didn’t. So I sat, assuming that’s what I was supposed to do. Sometime later, I began to fidget. I had to go to the bathroom, but was too shy to say anything. Jelila noticed my restlessness and asked if I was ok. I told her that I needed to use the restroom. She directed me to the bathroom, which was just off the porch inside a small guest bedroom. Once in the bathroom, I started to take in the surroundings. Colors appeared more brilliantly. Textures jumped out at me. The best way I could describe how I felt in the moment was a mix of psychedelic mushrooms with MDMA. What is going on, I thought. I stepped outside and back onto the porch. Jelila sat at another part of the porch in front of an easel painting a brilliant water color portrait of a nature scene. “How are you feeling?” She cheerfully asked. “I feel like I’m on psychedelics,” I responded slightly awe struck. “Yes,” she replied, “You’ve had a deeply healing experience. You’re welcome to lie down in the guest room if you’d like.” “Ok, thank you,” I responded. I went into the guest room and laid down on one of the small twin beds. The moment I closed my eyes, I saw the Star of David emblazoned across the cosmos with stars beaming across the deep blue universe. It was like I was viewing this scene on HDTV. The quality was incredibly crisp and the detail abundantly clear. I never had a vision like this before.';
const Human = 'In the fall of 2019, I met a close friend for the weekend in Woodstock. We had a beautiful time hiking, visiting the Buddhist monastery and eating at The Garden Café. During the last day of our adventure together, we stopped at a community spring recommended by our Airbnb host to fill up bottles with fresh water before heading home. When my friend and I arrived at the spring, we were met by a man in his 70’s wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. He had a cowboy vibe and was filling up massive water tanks that sat in the flat bed of his pickup truck. We politely said hello and made small talk about the rainy weather. He boasted that this spring had the best water for miles. \nSomehow the conversation veered into the realm of politics. This man clearly held different political views from my friend and me. He thought that Trump was the best thing to happen to our country - a smart businessman, who wasn’t out to rob the little guy unlike all the other politicians who came before him. The man bemoaned having to pay exorbitant government fees when he ran his construction company. He felt that Trump wanted to make it easier for the little guy to succeed. After explaining his political position, he stopped, looked at my friend and me and said “you ladies are probably a bunch of liberals, huh?” We told him that we weren’t fans of Trump, but didn’t have much faith in the government as a whole. “It’s a broken system,” I said. He then went on to tell us how when he got back from Vietnam, he got so much hate from the counterculture who saw him as a murderer. He recalled the overwhelming popularity of the Woodstock festival and how he couldn’t get gas at a nearby station due to the volume of attendees. As the man shared, I felt a sense of calm and ease wash over my friend and me. We didn’t try to persuade this man to adopt our views. We weren’t there to convince him that he was wrong. We were there to simply listen. As we were getting ready to head back to the car with our bottles of spring water, the man pleasantly remarked how “for a bunch of liberals, we were really easy to talk to.” He commented how he would never be able to talk to most liberals like he could with us. “Above all, I’m a human,” I responded. He chuckled. “Well, it was nice talking to you, ladies.” \nMy friend and I got back in my car and looked at each other with quiet amazement. We were tickled by what had just transpired. “That’s what we all need! Just to be listened to!” my friend exclaimed. The interaction that had just taken place reminded me of a passage from Brene Brown’s book, Braving the Wilderness. In that book, she talks about how damaging it is to dehumanize people who have a viewpoint in opposition to our own. She says when you’re up close to someone you can’t hate that person. Because when we are present with another human being, we can feel our shared humanity. It would have been easy to judge the man at the spring that day, to dehumanize him as an ignorant country bumpkin or whatever the judgement may be. But grace came through and allowed for the three of us to experience our shared humanity, which ultimately transcends political beliefs and ideologies. In truth, that experience was a rare moment for me, as I often find myself questioning the worldviews of the people on the other side of the political spectrum from me. However, that day by the spring lives on in my memory as a potent reminder of the power of presence, the need for all of us to be heard and the healing that compassion brings.';
const Bhudda = 'A few years ago, a colleague invited me to a Buddhist class in a downtrodden Upstate NY village. I narrowly assumed that whoever might be teaching Buddhism in such a rural place couldn’t possibly carry real spiritual depth. But my intuition nudged me to give the class a try. When I arrived at the class there were only four or five other people there all in their 50’s and 60’s. A few minutes before the class began, a bald man in his 80’s shuffled in wearing red Buddhist robes and flip flops. His blue eyes glistened with gentleness. He sat down, took a small Tibetan singing bowl out of his bag and placed it on the chair beside him. He rang the bell and for the next 20 minutes we all sat in silent meditation. At the end of the 20 minutes, the teacher, who I soon learned was named Tenzin, rang the bell again and everyone blinked their eyes open. The teacher’s gaze landed on me. He welcomed me with genuine warmth and kindness. His presence alone communicated trust and understanding. In that moment, I knew I had found a space of sage wisdom. \nOver the next couple years, I attended Tenzin’s class regularly. I enjoyed getting together with others to meditate as my life in Upstate NY felt isolated and I lacked a sense of community. During those two years or so that I attended Tenzin’s class, I was also riding the waves of a drama filled and toxic relationship. One evening before class, I had a heated argument with the person I was dating. This man had a way of homing in on my insecurities and manipulating me into believing that at my core I was a flawed and damaged human being. As I drove to class that night I sobbed in confusion and grief, wondering why someone who claimed to love me could simultaneously be so cruel and condescending. As I parked my car outside the library, I internally instructed myself to pull it together and stop crying. I didn’t want any of the people in the class to see my pain and struggle. I stoically entered the class and sat down, doing my best to hide my emotions from the group. Tenzin rang the bell and we closed our eyes for meditation. Within a few moments, tears were streaming down my cheeks. As much as my ego wanted to put up a persona of steadiness, my heart couldn’t hide the depth of pain I felt especially in a space where authenticity flowed. \nAt the end of the meditation, Tenzin rang the bell in the usual fashion. My emotional pain during the meditation was felt by Tenzin. He looked up at me and with deep compassion, he asked, “How are you doing?” I felt held by this simple yet thoughtful question. As I touched on the problems that I faced in my romantic life, Tenzin’s face showed concern and sadness. At the conclusion of my share, he sat quietly, receiving all that I had said. I didn’t need advice and Tenzin intuitively understood that. I simply needed a space to feel heard. I left class that night feeling less lonely and fearful. I took comfort in knowing that wise souls like Tenzin existed in the world and in my own backyard no less. \nOften the help and guidance we need is much closer than we realize. Had I not listened to my intuition and released my judgements about a Buddhist class in an abandoned factory town, I would have never stumbled upon this great teacher who ended up providing me with critical support in a time of extreme loneliness and confusion. The next time your intuition nudges you to try something new, but you find your mind putting up blocks, perhaps it’s time to release the doubt and see what magic may be in store. You might just find a Buddha in your own backyard. \nHow many times have you stumbled upon wise words in the most unexpected place?';
const Kam = 'During my trip to the Big Island of Hawaii this year, I partook in a transformative three-day kambo ceremony. I first learned about kambo only two weeks before my Hawaii trip. One afternoon, I was on a Zoom call with a friend who lives in Peru and was complaining to her about my swollen, achy knee, which I had recently injured from too much running. That’s when she told me about the wonders of kambo. My friend shared how when she first moved to Peru five years earlier, she injured her knee in gymnastics class and it swelled up to the size of a water balloon. She said that after just one session of kambo, the inflammation was almost completely gone. She explained Kambo as a super intense experience resulting in the body purging. I was intrigued that a natural substance could have such a profoundly positive effect on an injury, and thought how I could use something like that, never guessing that I would have the opportunity to only a few weeks later. \nOne afternoon during my stay in Hawaii, my partner, David, and I met my friend Jackie at a nearby beach. Jackie was with her friend Nikki, who was excited to share how she just had her second kambo session as part of a three day ceremony. David joked to her, “Do you see gnomes running around the beach?” She laughed and explained that kambo isn’t hallucinogenic. She explained that it comes from a frog in the Amazon and that indigenous cultures take the substance to detox the body. Unlike other Shamanic medicines, Kambo is completely legal. Again, I was intrigued but didn’t think I would actually sign up for such an experience. The following day I went to Jackie’s house to help her draft a contract. As Jackie and I were finishing up our meeting, Nikki emerged from the backyard with the Kambo facilitator, Sophia. Nikki had a spring in her step and a glow in her eyes. I admired the warm, positive energy that she exuded. Sophia, the facilitator, also had a grace and vibrancy about her. She was a British Pakistani woman who had been living on the Big Island since the beginning of the pandemic. As I packed up my things to head back to the rustic camp that my partner and I had been calling home, Jackie asked if I could drive Sophia back to her place. Immediately I knew that the Universe was conspiring for me to have a Kambo experience. I used our fifteen-minute car ride together to ask Sophia all my questions about Kambo. She encouraged my partner and I to do a three-day ceremony and offered to email me more information about the medicine. I told her that I felt the pull to do the ceremony, but I just needed to convince my partner. \nWhen I returned to our humble off the grid compound, David was hitting a wall with his school work and sat behind his laptop noticeably frustrated. On the other hand, I was beaming with joy and enthusiasm at the thought of having a kambo ceremony. “Babe!” I exclaimed. “I had the most magical time at Jackie’s. I got to meet the woman who facilitated Niccki’s kambo ceremony. I just drove her home. She told me all about kambo and I think it’s the answer to our prayers.” David looked at me with a degree of skepticism. “We have to do a ceremony!” I declared. “I have to read more about it. I’m not sure,” he flatly replied. “Well, Sophia leaves the island at the end of the month and has one three-day slot open the last weekend we’re here, so we have to let her know soon.” David assured me he would look more into it and make his decision soon. \nThat evening, David and I went to a sound bath at the Hawaiian sanctuary. A hippie couple in their 40’s played huge Tibetan singing bowls after passing out crystals to all the attendees to hold during the sound healing. The man offered his wisdom as the bowls echoed through the space – reminders to have faith in the Universe and trust the experience. Afterwards, David and I went to dinner at a local Thai restaurant feeling relaxed and content. As we sat waiting for our food, I noticed a new email from Sophia pop up on my phone. She shared that another couple inquired about doing a ceremony with her on the same three days that she offered David and me, so she needed to know as soon as possible whether we would be taking that slot. I explained the timeliness issue to David. “Let’s do it,” he responded. “Yes!” I exclaimed. I was so excited to embark on this kambo journey. \nOver the course of the next week, I incessantly browsed about kambo online. I wanted to read as many success stories as possible to prime my subconscious for a constructive experience. While I was happy to see so many people’s kambo experiences were positively transformative, I was anxious about the process itself. For example, many people recounted how immediately after the kambo was applied, they felt tremendous pressure in their head, swelling in their face and intense nausea until they violently vomited. I wondered how gracefully I would be able to weather these effects. One afternoon that week, I joined my online DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) group. The theme of the class was that pain and resistance frequently accompany positive transformation. One of the participants shared how, “very often we have to feel bad in order to feel good.” In that moment, I knew that would be my kambo experience. I could only experience its positive effects if I was willing to dance with its intensity and discomfort. \nOn day one of our three day ceremony, Sophia led David and I through the preparation protocol. First, we did a guided breath meditation to ground and get centered. Then we each chugged about half a gallon of water. After that, she had us roll up our left sleeve and proceeded to place a burn mark on the surface of the skin using something that resembled an incense stick. Then she applied the frog serum to the exposed dots on the arm. Within only a minute, I could feel the discomfort arising in my body. My head began to pressurize. I felt nauseous. A few tears rolled down my cheeks as the fear of the unknown bubbled to the surface. Within just a few minutes, David was purging into this bucket with ease. Sophia was impressed. I, on the other hand, just sat there in intense discomfort wondering when my purge would happen. Finally, I threw up but no where near to the degree that David did. About thirty minutes after Sophia applied the kambo, our bodies returned back to normal. The head pressure lifted. The nausea went away. Then Sophia had us lie down so that she could administer the shamanic eye drops called sananga, which are generally given right after a kambo ceremony. She warned us that it would feel like a hot chili pepper being dispersed into our eye. I thought the hardest part was over. I was wrong. Sophia dropped the yellowy solution into my eyes first. The burn that penetrated my pupils caused every part of my body to writhe and buck. I wanted this sensation to end immediately, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!” I yelled. David was also twisting and turning from the intensity of the burn. “Breathe,” Sophia sweetly hummed. “The shamanic way is through the pain.” Sophia’s words reminded me that to achieve the healing that I had prayed for, I would have to make peace with this painful passage. The burning sensation started to dissipate, but I could only open my eyes for a few seconds before they automatically clamped shut again. Finally, after close to ten minutes, I was able to keep my eyes open. The light from the sun felt so bright. The green of the plants surrounding us looked emerald. I felt alive, invigorated and cleansed. \nThe next two days of Kambo were just as challenging in their intensity, but the effects were undoubtedly worth the agony. For nearly three weeks following the Kambo session, I didn’t consume a drop of caffeine, which I generally find an indispensable part of my daily routine. I approached my legal work with a gusto and clarity that I hadn’t experienced in months, especially considering that before our trip, I was starting to show signs of burnout from work. I write this article about a month after our kambo ceremony. While I have taken up caffeine again, my consumption is much lighter than before. \nKambo gave me a much-needed boost in energy and vitality. Daily practices, such as yoga, movement and meditation are key for overall health, but sometimes the body needs an extra blast of support like what kambo can supply. Often the healing that we need comes in the most unexpected form. I never would have guessed that one day I would be in Hawaii having frog poison applied to my arm, but that is the magic and the beauty of life. Opportunities for healing come when we least expect them and often in the most surprising of packages.';
